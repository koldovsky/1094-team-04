                                    Still, we're not a vet clinic, so our vets provide only consultations and do not
                                    perform any
                                    procedures.</p>

                                <p>A pet sitter is a person that looks after your pets when you're out. It includes
                                    feeding, washing,
                                    providing walks and exercises, etc.</p>

                                <p>Sure, if you need a pet sitter just once, you can order such a service. Also, you can request a pet sitter for 1-2 hours and decide whether you want to use our services later.</p>
