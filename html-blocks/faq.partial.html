                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, we have 3 vets that specialize in different pets, from cats to parrots and
                    exotic animals. Still, we're not a vet clinic, so our vets provide only consultations and do not
                    perform any procedures.</p>

                    washing, providing walks and exercises, etc.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">Sure, if you need a pet sitter just once, you can order such a service. Also, you
                    can
                    request a pet sitter for 1-2 hours and decide whether you want to use our services later.</p>
